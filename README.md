# Crypto-info WebApp
Crypto-info is a crypto currency tracker with pagination and some basic info on the homepage. The number of currency
displayed is variable and the pagination adapt itself to this number. Every currency is clickable and it brings to a 
new page with more info and a chart. The time frame of the chart can be modified (day, week or year) and the data for each
time frame is fected dynamically.  

## One of the first apps I built with React Router.
